### üîß Next Steps
Awesome, Saibabu! Let‚Äôs kick off your **Advanced SQL Mastery Workbook** ‚Äî structured for clarity, depth, and real-world relevance. I‚Äôll build it section by section, starting with:

---

## üìò Module 1: Query Optimization

### üîπ 1.1 What Is Query Optimization?
Query optimization is the process of improving SQL queries to run faster and use fewer resources. It‚Äôs critical for large datasets, reporting systems, and automation pipelines.

---

### üî∏ 1.2 Indexing Basics

| Type         | Description                                | Example                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Single Index | Speeds up lookup on one column             | `CREATE INDEX idx_id ON emp(id);` |
| Composite    | Index on multiple columns                  | `CREATE INDEX idx_name_dept ON emp(name, dept);` |
| Covering     | Includes all columns needed for a query    | Used in SELECT-only queries      |

**Best Practice**: Use indexes on columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY`.

---

### üî∏ 1.3 Execution Plans

Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see how your query runs.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM emp WHERE dept = 'Sales';
```

Look for:
- **Seq Scan** ‚Üí full table scan (slow)
- **Index Scan** ‚Üí uses index (fast)
- **Nested Loop** ‚Üí join strategy

---

### üî∏ 1.4 Common Optimization Techniques

| Technique                  | Benefit                                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Use `LIMIT`               | Reduces result size                    |
| Avoid `SELECT *`          | Fetch only needed columns              |
| Filter early              | Push filters into subqueries           |
| Use CTEs wisely           | Avoid unnecessary materialization      |
| Partition large tables    | Speeds up scans and joins              |

---

### üî∏ 1.5 Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You‚Äôre building a dashboard that shows top 10 sales reps by region.

```sql
SELECT region, rep_name, total_sales
FROM (
  SELECT region, rep_name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) AS rank
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY region, rep_name
) ranked
WHERE rank <= 10;
```

**Optimization**:
- Add index on `(region, rep_name)`
- Use materialized view if data refreshes hourly

Fantastic, Saibabu! Let‚Äôs dive into **Module 2: Window Functions** ‚Äî one of the most powerful tools for analytics, reporting, and automation. This module will take you from foundational concepts to advanced use cases with examples and best practices.

---

## üßÆ Module 2: Window Functions

### üîπ 2.1 What Are Window Functions?

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows **related to the current row**, without collapsing the result set like `GROUP BY` does.

---

### üî∏ 2.2 Syntax Breakdown

```sql
function_name() OVER (
  [PARTITION BY column]
  [ORDER BY column]
  [ROWS BETWEEN ...]
)
```

- `PARTITION BY`: Resets the window for each group
- `ORDER BY`: Defines row order within each partition
- `ROWS BETWEEN`: Controls frame size (used in aggregates)

---

### üî∏ 2.3 Ranking Functions

| Function        | Description                          | Example |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()`  | Unique row number per partition      | `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC)` |
| `RANK()`        | Same rank for ties, gaps allowed     | `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC)` |
| `DENSE_RANK()`  | Same rank for ties, no gaps          | `DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC)` |

---

### üî∏ 2.4 Value Functions

| Function     | Description                          | Example |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `LEAD()`     | Next row‚Äôs value                     | `LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY id)` |
| `LAG()`      | Previous row‚Äôs value                 | `LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY id)` |
| `FIRST_VALUE()` | First value in partition          | `FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY id)` |
| `LAST_VALUE()`  | Last value in partition           | `LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY id)` |

---

### üî∏ 2.5 Aggregate Window Functions

```sql
SELECT emp_id, dept, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept) AS dept_total,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept) AS dept_avg
FROM employees;
```

- Keeps individual rows while showing group-level aggregates
- Ideal for dashboards and comparative reports

---

### üî∏ 2.6 NTILE and Bucketing

```sql
SELECT name, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS quartile
FROM students;
```

- Divides rows into equal-sized buckets
- Great for percentile analysis

---

### üî∏ 2.7 Frame Control (Advanced)

```sql
SUM(sales) OVER (
  PARTITION BY region
  ORDER BY month
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```

- Rolling totals, moving averages
- Custom frame sizes for time-series analytics

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want to show each employee‚Äôs salary, department average, and how they rank.

```sql
SELECT name, dept, salary,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept) AS dept_avg,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

Now I‚Äôll continue building the next module:

---

## üìä Module 3: Analytical Functions

### üîπ 3.1 What Are Analytical Functions?

Analytical functions extend `GROUP BY` logic to support **multi-level aggregations**, **dynamic summaries**, and **pivot-style reporting** ‚Äî all without losing row-level detail.

---

### üî∏ 3.2 GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, and CUBE

#### üîπ GROUPING SETS
Custom groupings in one query:
```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
  (region, product),
  (region),
  (product),
  ()
);
```

#### üîπ ROLLUP
Hierarchical totals:
```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY ROLLUP(region, product);
```

#### üîπ CUBE
All combinations:
```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY CUBE(region, product);
```

---

### üî∏ 3.3 GROUPING() Function

Detects NULLs created by ROLLUP/CUBE:
```sql
SELECT region, product,
       GROUPING(region) AS is_region_null,
       GROUPING(product) AS is_product_null,
       SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY CUBE(region, product);
```

---

### üî∏ 3.4 PIVOT and UNPIVOT

#### üîπ PIVOT (SQL Server, Oracle)
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT region, month, sales FROM sales_data
) src
PIVOT (
  SUM(sales) FOR month IN ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar')
) AS p;
```

#### üîπ UNPIVOT
```sql
SELECT region, month, sales
FROM sales_data
UNPIVOT (
  sales FOR month IN (jan_sales, feb_sales, mar_sales)
);
```

---

### üî∏ 3.5 Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want a report showing total sales by region, product, and overall.

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
  (region, product),
  (region),
  ()
);
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Write a query using `ROLLUP` to show total sales by category, subcategory, and grand total. Then use `GROUPING()` to label the subtotal rows.

 **Module 4: Joins Mastery** 
 Thanks for the nudge, Saibabu! Since I can‚Äôt generate downloadable files directly, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do instead:

- I‚Äôll continue building **Module 4: Joins Mastery** right here in chat.
- Once we‚Äôve completed all 15 modules, I‚Äôll format everything into a **Copilot Page** ‚Äî a clean, editable surface where you can organize, refine, and reuse this SQL workbook anytime.

Let‚Äôs dive into the next module:

---

## üîó Module 4: Joins Mastery

### üîπ 4.1 What Are Joins?

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. They‚Äôre essential for relational data modeling, reporting, and analytics.

---

### üî∏ 4.2 Core Join Types

| Join Type     | Description                                      | Example |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `INNER JOIN`  | Matches rows in both tables                      | `SELECT * FROM emp JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;` |
| `LEFT JOIN`   | All rows from left + matched from right          | `SELECT * FROM emp LEFT JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;` |
| `RIGHT JOIN`  | All rows from right + matched from left          | `SELECT * FROM emp RIGHT JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;` |
| `FULL JOIN`   | All rows from both sides, matched where possible | `SELECT * FROM emp FULL JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;` |

---

### üî∏ 4.3 Advanced Join Types

| Join Type       | Use Case                                      | Example |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `SELF JOIN`     | Compare rows within the same table            | `SELECT e1.name, e2.name FROM emp e1 JOIN emp e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;` |
| `CROSS JOIN`    | Cartesian product (all combinations)          | `SELECT * FROM colors CROSS JOIN sizes;` |
| `ANTI JOIN`     | Rows in A not in B                            | `SELECT * FROM emp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dept WHERE emp.dept_id = dept.id);` |
| `SEMI JOIN`     | Rows in A that match B (no B columns returned)| `SELECT * FROM emp WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dept WHERE emp.dept_id = dept.id);` |

---

### üî∏ 4.4 Join Filters vs WHERE Filters

```sql
-- Join filter
SELECT * FROM emp JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id AND dept.region = 'South';

-- WHERE filter
SELECT * FROM emp JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id WHERE dept.region = 'South';
```

**Best Practice**: Use join filters for performance when filtering during join.

---

### üî∏ 4.5 Join Optimization Tips

- Index foreign keys and join columns
- Avoid joining on non-indexed expressions
- Use `EXISTS` for filtering, `JOIN` for combining
- Use `WITH` (CTEs) to isolate logic

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want a report showing employees, their department names, and managers.

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee,
       d.name AS department,
       m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

---
Absolutely, Saibabu ‚Äî here‚Äôs a deep dive into **Join Optimization Tips (4.5)** with clear examples and reasoning tailored for your reporting and automation goals:

---

## üîß 4.5 Join Optimization Tips ‚Äî Explained with Examples

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Index Foreign Keys and Join Columns

**Why**: Indexes speed up join operations by allowing the database to quickly locate matching rows.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Index the foreign key column
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_id ON employees(dept_id);

-- Join becomes faster
SELECT e.name, d.name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

**Best Practice**: Always index columns used in `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`.

---

### üö´ 2. Avoid Joining on Non-Indexed Expressions

**Why**: Expressions prevent index usage, forcing full table scans.

**Bad Example**:
```sql
-- This disables index usage
SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON UPPER(o.cust_name) = UPPER(c.name);
```

**Optimized Version**:
```sql
-- Normalize data before joining
SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.cust_name = c.name;
```

**Tip**: Avoid functions (`UPPER`, `TRIM`, `CAST`) on join keys.

---

### üîç 3. Use `EXISTS` for Filtering, `JOIN` for Combining

**Why**: `EXISTS` is faster for checking existence, especially with subqueries.

**Filtering Example (EXISTS)**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE d.id = e.dept_id AND d.region = 'South'
);
```

**Combining Example (JOIN)**:
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
WHERE d.region = 'South';
```

**Rule of Thumb**:
- Use `JOIN` when you need columns from both tables.
- Use `EXISTS` when you only care about presence.

---

### üß† 4. Use `WITH` (CTEs) to Isolate Logic

**Why**: Common Table Expressions (CTEs) improve readability and can help the optimizer reuse logic.

**Example**:
```sql
WITH top_sales AS (
  SELECT emp_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY emp_id
  HAVING SUM(sales) > 100000
)
SELECT e.name, ts.total_sales
FROM employees e
JOIN top_sales ts ON e.id = ts.emp_id;
```

**Benefits**:
- Modular logic
- Easier debugging
- Can improve performance if reused multiple times

---

### üß™ Real-World Scenario

**Problem**: You need to list employees in high-performing departments, but only if those departments have >10 employees.

**Optimized Query**:
```sql
WITH big_depts AS (
  SELECT dept_id
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY dept_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
)
SELECT e.name, d.name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
WHERE e.dept_id IN (SELECT dept_id FROM big_depts);
```

Excellent, Saibabu! Let‚Äôs keep the momentum going with **Module 5: Set Operations** ‚Äî a powerful toolset for comparing, merging, and filtering datasets across tables or queries.

---

## üîÅ Module 5: Set Operations

### üîπ 5.1 What Are Set Operations?

Set operations allow you to combine results from multiple `SELECT` queries, similar to how sets work in mathematics. They‚Äôre ideal for deduplication, comparisons, and union-style reporting.

---

### üî∏ 5.2 Core Set Operators

| Operator       | Description                                      | Duplicates Allowed? |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `UNION`        | Combines results, removes duplicates             | ‚ùå No                |
| `UNION ALL`    | Combines results, keeps duplicates               | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| `INTERSECT`    | Returns rows common to both queries              | ‚ùå No                |
| `EXCEPT`       | Returns rows in first query but not in second    | ‚ùå No                |

---

### üî∏ 5.3 Syntax Examples

#### üîπ UNION
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

#### üîπ UNION ALL
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

#### üîπ INTERSECT
```sql
SELECT email FROM customers
INTERSECT
SELECT email FROM newsletter_subscribers;
```

#### üîπ EXCEPT
```sql
SELECT email FROM customers
EXCEPT
SELECT email FROM unsubscribed_users;
```

---

### üî∏ 5.4 Rules and Best Practices

- All queries must have **same number of columns** and **compatible data types**.
- Use `ORDER BY` only **after** the final set operation.
- Use `DISTINCT` inside subqueries if needed for performance.
- Prefer `UNION ALL` when duplicates are acceptable ‚Äî it‚Äôs faster.

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want to find all users who are either employees or contractors, but not both.

```sql
-- Employees only
SELECT name FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM contractors;

-- Contractors only
SELECT name FROM contractors
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM employees;
```

---

Let‚Äôs roll into **Module 6: Recursive Queries**, Saibabu ‚Äî a powerful technique for handling hierarchical or self-referencing data like org charts, category trees, and bill-of-materials structures. This module will take you from foundational syntax to advanced traversal logic.

---

## üå≥ Module 6: Recursive Queries

### üîπ 6.1 What Are Recursive Queries?

Recursive queries allow you to repeatedly apply a query to its own result ‚Äî perfect for navigating parent-child relationships or building chains of logic.

They‚Äôre built using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** with the `WITH RECURSIVE` clause.

---

### üî∏ 6.2 Syntax Breakdown

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
  -- Anchor member (base case)
  SELECT ...

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive member (refers to cte_name)
  SELECT ...
  FROM cte_name
  JOIN ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

- **Anchor**: Starting point (e.g., top-level manager)
- **Recursive**: Builds on previous result
- **UNION ALL**: Combines both parts

---

### üî∏ 6.3 Example: Employee Hierarchy

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
  FROM employees e
  JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart;
```

- Starts with top-level managers
- Recursively adds direct reports
- Tracks hierarchy depth with `level`

---

### üî∏ 6.4 Example: Category Tree

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
  SELECT id, name, parent_id
  FROM categories
  WHERE parent_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  SELECT c.id, c.name, c.parent_id
  FROM categories c
  JOIN category_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT * FROM category_tree;
```

---

### üî∏ 6.5 Advanced Techniques

| Technique             | Purpose                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `LIMIT` recursion     | Prevent infinite loops                 |
| `LEVEL` tracking      | Add depth column                       |
| `PATH` building       | Concatenate hierarchy path             |
| `CYCLE` detection     | Avoid circular references              |

**Cycle-safe example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM category_tree
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT parent_id FROM category_tree);
```

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want to generate a report showing each employee, their manager, and their level in the org chart.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
  FROM employees e
  JOIN hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy ORDER BY level, name;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Write a recursive query to list all categories and subcategories in a hierarchy, including their depth level and full path (e.g., "Electronics > Phones > Android").
A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** is a temporary result set in SQL that you define using the `WITH` clause. It makes complex queries easier to read, debug, and reuse ‚Äî especially when dealing with subqueries, recursion, or modular logic.

---

## üß† CTE Basics

### üîπ Syntax
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
  SELECT ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

- Think of it as a named subquery.
- It exists only during the execution of the main query.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Simple CTE

```sql
WITH high_earners AS (
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM high_earners;
```

- Filters high-salary employees.
- Makes the main query cleaner and modular.

---

### üîÑ Use Cases

| Use Case                     | Benefit                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Simplify nested subqueries   | Improves readability                 |
| Reuse logic across joins     | Avoids duplication                   |
| Enable recursion             | Required for hierarchical queries    |
| Modular reporting            | Easier to maintain and debug         |

---

### üîÅ Recursive CTE Example

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
  FROM employees e
  JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart;
```

- Builds an employee hierarchy.
- Tracks depth with `level`.
Perfect, Saibabu! Here's your **CTE Comparison Cheat Sheet** ‚Äî showing how **CTEs**, **subqueries**, and **temporary tables** differ in structure, use cases, and performance. This will help you choose the right tool for reporting, automation, and modular SQL design.

Let‚Äôs power into **Module 7: Transactions & Control**, Saibabu ‚Äî a critical skillset for building reliable, error-proof SQL workflows, especially in automation, reporting, and financial systems.

---

## üîê Module 7: Transactions & Control

### üîπ 7.1 What Is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a sequence of SQL operations that are treated as a single unit. It ensures **atomicity** ‚Äî either all operations succeed, or none do.

---

### üî∏ 7.2 Core Transaction Commands

| Command     | Purpose                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `BEGIN`     | Starts a transaction                     |
| `COMMIT`    | Saves all changes                        |
| `ROLLBACK`  | Undoes all changes since `BEGIN`         |
| `SAVEPOINT` | Marks a checkpoint within a transaction  |
| `ROLLBACK TO` | Reverts to a savepoint                 |

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Basic Transaction

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

If anything fails, you can `ROLLBACK` to undo both updates.

---

### üî∏ 7.3 Using SAVEPOINT

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE item_id = 101;
SAVEPOINT deduct_stock;

UPDATE payments SET status = 'paid' WHERE order_id = 202;

-- Something goes wrong
ROLLBACK TO deduct_stock;

COMMIT;
```

- Only the second update is undone.
- The first update remains.

---

### üî∏ 7.4 Isolation Levels (Advanced)

| Level              | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `READ UNCOMMITTED` | Can read uncommitted changes (dirty reads)       |
| `READ COMMITTED`   | Default ‚Äî only committed data is visible         |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Prevents non-repeatable reads                    |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | Strictest ‚Äî full isolation, may block other txns |

**Set isolation level** (PostgreSQL):
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

---

### üî∏ 7.5 Error Handling with Transactions

```sql
BEGIN;

-- risky operation
UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 999;

-- simulate failure
IF NOT FOUND THEN
  ROLLBACK;
ELSE
  COMMIT;
END IF;
```

Use conditional logic or exception blocks in stored procedures to handle failures gracefully.

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You‚Äôre automating a payment + inventory update. If either fails, rollback everything.

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE item_id = 101;
UPDATE payments SET status = 'paid' WHERE order_id = 202;

-- Check for errors
IF error THEN
  ROLLBACK;
ELSE
  COMMIT;
END IF;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Write a transaction that deducts stock, updates payment status, and logs the action. If any step fails, rollback everything. Add a savepoint after the stock deduction.

---
Let‚Äôs dive into **Module 8: Constraints & Integrity**, Saibabu ‚Äî the backbone of reliable database design. This module ensures your data stays clean, consistent, and trustworthy, especially in automated systems and reporting pipelines.

---

## üß± Module 8: Constraints & Integrity

### üîπ 8.1 What Are Constraints?

Constraints are rules enforced by the database to maintain **data integrity**. They prevent invalid, duplicate, or inconsistent data from entering your tables.

---

### üî∏ 8.2 Types of Constraints

| Constraint       | Purpose                                      | Example |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `PRIMARY KEY`    | Uniquely identifies each row                 | `id INT PRIMARY KEY` |
| `FOREIGN KEY`    | Enforces relationship between tables         | `FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(id)` |
| `UNIQUE`         | Ensures no duplicate values                  | `email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE` |
| `NOT NULL`       | Prevents missing values                      | `name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL` |
| `CHECK`          | Validates custom conditions                  | `age INT CHECK (age >= 18)` |
| `DEFAULT`        | Sets a default value if none is provided     | `status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'active'` |

---

### üî∏ 8.3 PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE

| Feature         | PRIMARY KEY           | UNIQUE              |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Uniqueness      | ‚úÖ Required            | ‚úÖ Required          |
| Nulls Allowed   | ‚ùå Not allowed         | ‚úÖ Allowed (one null)|
| Index Created   | ‚úÖ Automatically       | ‚úÖ Automatically     |
| Use Case        | Row identity           | Business rules (e.g., email) |

---

### üî∏ 8.4 FOREIGN KEY with Cascading Actions

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
    REFERENCES customers(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Deletes related orders when a customer is deleted.
- `ON UPDATE CASCADE`: Updates foreign key when parent key changes.

---

### üî∏ 8.5 CHECK Constraints

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  age INT CHECK (age BETWEEN 18 AND 65),
  salary DECIMAL CHECK (salary > 0)
);
```

- Enforces business rules directly in schema.
- Can use expressions, ranges, or conditions.

---

### üî∏ 8.6 DEFAULT Values

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- Simplifies inserts
- Ensures consistent initial values

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You‚Äôre designing a reporting system for employee records. You want to ensure:
- Every employee has a unique ID and email
- Age must be ‚â• 18
- Department must exist in the `departments` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
  dept_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Design a `products` table with the following rules:
- `id` is the primary key
- `price` must be positive
- `category_id` must reference a `categories` table
- `stock` defaults to 0
- `sku` must be unique

--
Let‚Äôs jump into **Module 9: Triggers & Procedures**, Saibabu ‚Äî a powerhouse combo for automating logic, enforcing rules, and building intelligent workflows directly inside your database.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Module 9: Triggers & Procedures

### üîπ 9.1 What Are Triggers?

A **trigger** is a database object that automatically executes a block of code in response to a specific event on a table ‚Äî like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.

---

### üî∏ 9.2 Trigger Syntax (PostgreSQL Example)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_insert()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO audit_log(table_name, action, timestamp)
  VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER after_insert_trigger
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_insert();
```

- `TG_TABLE_NAME`: Table name where trigger fired
- `TG_OP`: Operation type (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.)

---

### üî∏ 9.3 Trigger Types

| Type             | Fires On         | Use Case                          |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `BEFORE INSERT`  | Before row insert| Validate or modify data           |
| `AFTER INSERT`   | After row insert | Audit, notify, cascade actions    |
| `BEFORE UPDATE`  | Before update    | Enforce business rules            |
| `AFTER DELETE`   | After delete     | Archive, log, cleanup             |

---

### üîπ 9.4 What Are Stored Procedures?

A **stored procedure** is a reusable block of SQL logic that can accept parameters, perform operations, and return results. It‚Äôs ideal for encapsulating business logic.

---

### üî∏ 9.5 Procedure Syntax (MySQL Example)

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE update_salary (
  IN emp_id INT,
  IN increment DECIMAL(10,2)
)
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = salary + increment
  WHERE id = emp_id;
END;
```

To call it:
```sql
CALL update_salary(101, 5000);
```

---

### üî∏ 9.6 Procedure Features

| Feature         | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Parameters      | `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`                 |
| Control Flow    | `IF`, `CASE`, `LOOP`, `WHILE`        |
| Error Handling  | `DECLARE HANDLER`, `TRY...CATCH`     |
| Transactions    | Can include `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` |

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want to automatically log every time a new employee is added, and also provide a procedure to bulk update salaries.

- **Trigger** logs the insert:
```sql
AFTER INSERT ON employees ‚Üí INSERT INTO audit_log(...)
```

- **Procedure** updates salaries:
```sql
CALL update_salary(emp_id, increment);
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Write a trigger that logs every deletion from the `orders` table into an `order_archive` table. Then write a stored procedure that accepts a `customer_id` and returns their total order value.

---
Let‚Äôs move into **Module 10: Materialized Views**, Saibabu ‚Äî a performance-focused feature that‚Äôs perfect for speeding up dashboards, reports, and recurring analytics in your automation workflows.

---

## üßä Module 10: Materialized Views

### üîπ 10.1 What Is a Materialized View?

A **materialized view** stores the result of a query physically in the database. Unlike regular views, it doesn‚Äôt re-run the query every time ‚Äî making it ideal for expensive aggregations and slow joins.

---

### üî∏ 10.2 Syntax (PostgreSQL Example)

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```

- Acts like a snapshot of the query result.
- Can be queried like a table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
```

---

### üî∏ 10.3 Refreshing the View

| Method                  | Description                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Re-runs the query and updates the view |
| `WITH DATA`             | Default ‚Äî refreshes with new data        |
| `WITH NO DATA`          | Creates empty shell (manual refresh later)|

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

---

### üî∏ 10.4 Use Cases

| Scenario                          | Benefit                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Heavy aggregations               | Avoid repeated computation       |
| Dashboard metrics                | Fast load times                  |
| Snapshot reporting               | Point-in-time analysis           |
| ETL staging                      | Intermediate result caching      |

---

### üî∏ 10.5 Performance Tips

- Index materialized views if needed:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_region ON sales_summary(region);
  ```
- Use `WITH NO DATA` for fast creation during schema setup.
- Schedule refreshes using cron jobs or event triggers.

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want to show daily sales totals on a dashboard, but querying the full `sales_data` table is slow.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales AS
SELECT sale_date, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY sale_date;

-- Refresh daily
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Create a materialized view that summarizes total revenue by product category. Then write a query to refresh it and filter for categories with revenue > ‚Çπ1,00,000.

Got it, Saibabu! Here's your complete **Module 12: Security & Access**, now fully integrated with a dedicated section on **REVOKE** ‚Äî including 12 practical examples for managing access in real-world SQL environments.

---

## üîê Module 12: Security & Access

### üîπ 12.1 Why It Matters

Security ensures:
- Only authorized users can access or modify data
- Sensitive information is protected
- Actions are traceable for audits and compliance

---

### üî∏ 12.2 GRANT & REVOKE Overview

| Command | Purpose                          | Example |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------|
| `GRANT` | Assigns privileges to users/roles | `GRANT SELECT ON employees TO analyst;` |
| `REVOKE` | Removes privileges                | `REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM analyst;` |

---

### üî∏ 12.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```sql
CREATE ROLE reporting_user;
GRANT SELECT ON sales_data TO reporting_user;
GRANT reporting_user TO saibabu;
```

- Roles simplify permission management
- Supports least-privilege principle

---

### üî∏ 12.4 Row-Level Security (RLS)

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY dept_filter
ON employees
FOR SELECT
USING (dept_id = current_setting('app.dept_id')::INT);

SET app.dept_id = 101;
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

- Restricts access to rows based on context
- Ideal for multi-tenant dashboards

---

### üî∏ 12.5 Auditing with Triggers

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_update
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO audit_log VALUES (CURRENT_USER, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'UPDATE', OLD.id);
```

- Tracks who changed what and when
- Supports compliance and rollback analysis

---

### üî∏ 12.6 REVOKE: 12 Practical Examples

| # | Scenario | SQL Command |
|--|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Remove read access from analyst | `REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM analyst;` |
| 2 | Block data entry role from modifying orders | `REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON orders FROM data_entry_clerk;` |
| 3 | Prevent user from deleting transactions | `REVOKE DELETE ON transactions FROM saibabu;` |
| 4 | Stop intern from executing salary update | `REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE update_salary FROM intern;` |
| 5 | Remove all access from temp_user | `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON customers FROM temp_user;` |
| 6 | Block schema usage | `REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA finance FROM auditor;` |
| 7 | Block sequence access | `REVOKE USAGE ON SEQUENCE invoice_seq FROM saibabu;` |
| 8 | Remove role membership | `REVOKE reporting_user FROM saibabu;` |
| 9 | Remove view access | `REVOKE SELECT ON sales_summary_view FROM analyst;` |
|10 | Prevent inserts on materialized view | `REVOKE INSERT ON daily_sales_mv FROM data_loader;` |
|11 | Block function execution | `REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_employee_bonus FROM saibabu;` |
|12 | Restrict column-level updates | `REVOKE UPDATE(name, email) ON employees FROM intern;` |

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You want to allow analysts to view sales data but not modify it, and restrict each analyst to their assigned region.

```sql
-- Grant read-only access
GRANT SELECT ON sales_data TO analyst;

-- Enable row-level security
ALTER TABLE sales_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: only see assigned region
CREATE POLICY region_filter
ON sales_data
FOR SELECT
USING (region = current_setting('app.region'));
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Create a role called `auditor` that can only read from the `transactions` table. Then write a row-level security policy that restricts access to rows where `status = 'approved'`. Finally, revoke all modification privileges from that role.

--
Let‚Äôs move into **Module 14: Partitioning & Sharding**, Saibabu ‚Äî a high-performance strategy for scaling large datasets, improving query speed, and optimizing storage in enterprise-grade SQL systems.

---

## üß© Module 14: Partitioning & Sharding

### üîπ 14.1 Why Partitioning Matters

Partitioning splits a large table into smaller, manageable pieces ‚Äî called **partitions** ‚Äî based on column values. It improves:
- Query performance
- Maintenance efficiency
- Parallel processing

---

### üî∏ 14.2 Types of Partitioning

| Type           | Description                                | Example Use Case |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Range**      | Based on value ranges                      | Date-based logs  |
| **List**       | Based on specific values                   | Region or category |
| **Hash**       | Even distribution using hash function      | Load balancing   |
| **Composite**  | Combines two types                         | Region + Date    |

---

### üî∏ 14.3 Range Partitioning Example (PostgreSQL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
  id INT,
  sale_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date);

CREATE TABLE sales_2025 PARTITION OF sales
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-12-31');
```

- Queries on `sale_date` will only scan relevant partitions.

---

### üî∏ 14.4 List Partitioning Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT,
  region TEXT
) PARTITION BY LIST (region);

CREATE TABLE orders_south PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES IN ('South');
```

---

### üî∏ 14.5 Hash Partitioning Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
  id INT,
  message TEXT
) PARTITION BY HASH (id);

CREATE TABLE logs_part1 PARTITION OF logs FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 0);
CREATE TABLE logs_part2 PARTITION OF logs FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 1);
```

- Distributes rows evenly across partitions.

---

### üî∏ 14.6 Sharding (Distributed Partitioning)

**Sharding** splits data across multiple servers or databases ‚Äî ideal for horizontal scaling.

| Feature         | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Node-based      | Each shard lives on a separate node  |
| Query routing   | Middleware directs queries to shards |
| Use case        | Multi-region apps, massive datasets  |

**Example Strategy**:
- Shard by `customer_id` range
- Route queries using metadata or proxy layer

---

### üî∏ 14.7 Best Practices

- Index partition keys
- Avoid cross-partition joins
- Use partition pruning (`WHERE` clause on partition key)
- Monitor partition size and balance

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You manage a `transactions` table with millions of rows per year. You want to optimize reporting by year.

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id INT,
  txn_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (txn_date);

CREATE TABLE transactions_2024 PARTITION OF transactions
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');

CREATE TABLE transactions_2025 PARTITION OF transactions
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-12-31');
```

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Create a `logs` table partitioned by month using range partitioning. Then write a query that retrieves logs from September 2025 using partition pruning.

---

Let‚Äôs wrap up your SQL Mastery Workbook with **Module 15: Error Handling**, Saibabu ‚Äî a vital skill for building resilient, audit-proof, and automation-ready SQL systems that don‚Äôt break under pressure.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Module 15: Error Handling

### üîπ 15.1 Why Error Handling Matters

Error handling ensures:
- Transactions don‚Äôt leave data in an inconsistent state
- Failures are logged and traceable
- Automation scripts can recover or retry safely

---

### üî∏ 15.2 Basic Transactional Safety

```sql
BEGIN;

-- risky operation
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

If anything fails, use:
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

---

### üî∏ 15.3 SAVEPOINT and Partial Rollback

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE item_id = 101;
SAVEPOINT after_stock;

UPDATE payments SET status = 'paid' WHERE order_id = 202;

-- simulate failure
ROLLBACK TO after_stock;

COMMIT;
```

- Only rolls back to the savepoint
- Keeps earlier successful steps

---

### üî∏ 15.4 Error Handling in Stored Procedures (MySQL)

```sql
DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO error_log VALUES ('update_salary failed', NOW());
END;
```

- Catches SQL errors
- Logs them without crashing the procedure

---

### üî∏ 15.5 Error Handling in PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL)

```sql
BEGIN
  -- risky logic
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    INSERT INTO error_log VALUES (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Failure in procedure');
    RAISE NOTICE 'Error handled';
END;
```

- `WHEN OTHERS` catches all exceptions
- You can log, notify, or re-raise

---

### üî∏ 15.6 Retry Logic (Advanced)

Use loops or external scripts to retry failed operations:
```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  attempts INT := 0;
BEGIN
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      -- risky operation
      EXIT;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        attempts := attempts + 1;

### üî∏ 15.7 Logging Errors

```sql
CREATE TABLE error_log (
  error_time TIMESTAMP,
  error_message TEXT,
  user_name TEXT
);

-- Insert on failure
INSERT INTO error_log VALUES (NOW(), 'Payment failed', CURRENT_USER);
```

- Supports audit trails
- Can be integrated with monitoring tools

---

### üß™ Real-World Use Case

**Scenario**: You‚Äôre automating a payment + inventory update. If either fails, rollback and log the error.

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE item_id = 101;
SAVEPOINT after_stock;

UPDATE payments SET status = 'paid' WHERE order_id = 202;

-- simulate failure
ROLLBACK TO after_stock;
INSERT INTO error_log VALUES (NOW(), 'Payment update failed', CURRENT_USER);

COMMIT;
```

### ‚úÖ Practice Challenge

> Write a stored procedure that deducts stock and updates payment status. If any step fails, rollback and log the error with a timestamp and user name.

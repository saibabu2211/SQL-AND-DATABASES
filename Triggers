Here‚Äôs a complete walkthrough of SQL **triggers** from start to finish, tailored for MySQL (but I‚Äôll note differences for other databases too). This includes syntax, types, examples, and best practices‚Äîall in one modular guide.

## üß† What Is a Trigger?

A **trigger** is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to a specific event on a table: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.

---

## üß© Trigger Lifecycle Overview

| Phase        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Create**   | Define the trigger with event and timing |
| **Fire**     | Trigger executes when the event occurs |
| **Access**   | Use `OLD` and `NEW` to access row data |
| **Drop**     | Remove the trigger when no longer needed |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Trigger Syntax (MySQL)

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Trigger logic here
END;
```

### üîë Keywords
- `BEFORE` or `AFTER`: When the trigger runs
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`: What event triggers it
- `FOR EACH ROW`: Applies to every affected row
- `OLD`: Refers to the row before change (used in `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- `NEW`: Refers to the row after change (used in `INSERT`, `UPDATE`)

---

## üì¶ Examples

### 1. Audit Log on DELETE

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_deletion
AFTER DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (emp_id, deleted_at)
    VALUES (OLD.id, NOW());
END;
```

### 2. Validate Salary Before Insert

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER validate_salary
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.salary < 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary cannot be negative';
    END IF;
END;
```

### 3. Track Changes on UPDATE

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER track_update
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO change_log (emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, changed_at)
    VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NOW());
END;
```

## üßπ Dropping a Trigger

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name;
```

## üß≠ Differences Across Databases

| Feature         | MySQL                     | PostgreSQL                  | SQL Server                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `OLD` / `NEW`   | Supported                 | Supported                   | Uses `INSERTED` / `DELETED` tables |
| `SIGNAL`        | Supported for errors      | Use `RAISE EXCEPTION`       | Use `THROW` or `RAISERROR` |
| `FOR EACH ROW`  | Required                  | Required                    | Not used (works on batches) |
| Multiple Triggers | Allowed per event       | Allowed                     | Only one per event per table |

Would you like a cheat sheet comparing syntax across MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server? Or a real-world use case like auto-invoicing or inventory sync?

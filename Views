### üìå What is a View?

A **view** is a virtual table based on a `SELECT` query. It doesn't store data but lets you reuse complex queries as if they were tables.

---

### üß± 1. Creating a Basic View

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

‚úÖ **Use Case:** Simplify repeated queries, hide sensitive columns, or create read-only dashboards.

---

### üîÅ 2. Updating a View

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE ...;
```

‚úÖ **Use Case:** Modify the logic or columns without dropping the view.

---

### üîÑ 3. Dropping a View

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

---

### üîó 4. Views with Joins

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_department AS
SELECT 
  e.emp_id,
  e.name,
  d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

‚úÖ **Use Case:** Combine data across tables for reporting.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Views with joins are **not updatable** unless they meet strict conditions.

---

### üìä 5. Views with Aggregations

```sql
CREATE VIEW dept_summary AS
SELECT 
  dept_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```

‚úÖ **Use Case:** Create reusable summary reports.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Views with `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc. are **not updatable**.

---

### üß† 6. Updatable Views ‚Äî Rules

| Feature        | Updatable? | Reason |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Single table   | ‚úÖ Yes      | Direct row mapping |
| No joins       | ‚úÖ Yes      | No ambiguity |
| No aggregation | ‚úÖ Yes      | No summary rows |
| With `JOIN`    | ‚ùå No       | Multiple source rows |
| With `GROUP BY`| ‚ùå No       | Aggregated data |
| With `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`, `UNION` | ‚ùå No | Breaks row traceability |

---

### üß™ 7. Example of an Updatable View

```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_basic AS
SELECT emp_id, name, salary
FROM employees;
```

```sql
UPDATE emp_basic SET salary = 75000 WHERE emp_id = 101;
```

‚úÖ Works because each row maps directly to `employees`.

---

### üîê 8. Security & Performance Notes

| Topic       | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Data Storage | Views don‚Äôt store data |
| Performance | Depends on base query complexity |
| Security    | Views can restrict column access |
| Indexing    | Views don‚Äôt have indexes ‚Äî rely on base tables |

---

### üìÅ 9. Best Practices

- Use views to **encapsulate business logic**
- Avoid joins and aggregations if you need **updatability**
- Use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` for safe updates
- Document view purpose and limitations in comments

Great question, Saibabu ‚Äî and one that‚Äôs crucial for understanding how MySQL handles **view updatability**. Here's a breakdown of **why only simple views (single-table, no aggregation) can be updated**, with examples and reasoning:

---

## üß† Why Only Simple Views Are Updatable

### ‚úÖ Updatable Views Must Map Directly to Base Table Rows

MySQL allows updates to views **only if it can clearly trace each row in the view back to a single row in a base table**. This is possible only when:
- The view is based on **one table**
- There are **no joins**
- There are **no aggregations**, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`, or `UNION`

---

### ‚ùå Why Joins Break Updatability

**Problem:** When a view includes `JOIN`, each row in the view may represent **multiple base rows**.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_dept AS
SELECT e.emp_id, e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

You cannot run:
```sql
UPDATE emp_dept SET dept_name = 'Finance' WHERE emp_id = 101;
```

**Why?** Because `dept_name` comes from `departments`, not `employees`. MySQL doesn‚Äôt know which table to update safely.

---

### ‚ùå Why Aggregations Break Updatability

**Problem:** Aggregated rows represent **summaries**, not individual records.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW dept_summary AS
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```

You cannot run:
```sql
UPDATE dept_summary SET avg_salary = 80000 WHERE dept_id = 2;
```

**Why?** `avg_salary` is a computed value ‚Äî there‚Äôs no single row to update in `employees`.

---

### ‚úÖ What Makes a View Updatable?

| Feature | Updatable? | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Single table | ‚úÖ Yes | Direct row mapping |
| No joins | ‚úÖ Yes | No ambiguity |
| No aggregation | ‚úÖ Yes | No summary rows |
| No `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `LIMIT`, `UNION` | ‚úÖ Yes | Keeps row-level traceability |

---

### üß™ Example of an Updatable View

```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_basic AS
SELECT emp_id, name, salary
FROM employees;
```

You **can** run:
```sql
UPDATE emp_basic SET salary = 75000 WHERE emp_id = 101;
```

Because each row maps directly to a row in `employees`.

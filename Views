### 📌 What is a View?

A **view** is a virtual table based on a `SELECT` query. It doesn't store data but lets you reuse complex queries as if they were tables.

---

### 🧱 1. Creating a Basic View

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

✅ **Use Case:** Simplify repeated queries, hide sensitive columns, or create read-only dashboards.

---

### 🔁 2. Updating a View

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE ...;
```

✅ **Use Case:** Modify the logic or columns without dropping the view.

---

### 🔄 3. Dropping a View

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

---

### 🔗 4. Views with Joins

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_department AS
SELECT 
  e.emp_id,
  e.name,
  d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

✅ **Use Case:** Combine data across tables for reporting.

⚠️ **Note:** Views with joins are **not updatable** unless they meet strict conditions.

---

### 📊 5. Views with Aggregations

```sql
CREATE VIEW dept_summary AS
SELECT 
  dept_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```

✅ **Use Case:** Create reusable summary reports.

⚠️ **Note:** Views with `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc. are **not updatable**.

### 🧠 6. Updatable Views — Rules

| Feature        | Updatable? | Reason |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Single table   | ✅ Yes      | Direct row mapping |
| No joins       | ✅ Yes      | No ambiguity |
| No aggregation | ✅ Yes      | No summary rows |
| With `JOIN`    | ❌ No       | Multiple source rows |
| With `GROUP BY`| ❌ No       | Aggregated data |
| With `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`, `UNION` | ❌ No | Breaks row traceability |

---

### 🧪 7. Example of an Updatable View

```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_basic AS
SELECT emp_id, name, salary
FROM employees;
```

```sql
UPDATE emp_basic SET salary = 75000 WHERE emp_id = 101;
```

✅ Works because each row maps directly to `employees`.

### 🔐 8. Security & Performance Notes

| Topic       | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Data Storage | Views don’t store data |
| Performance | Depends on base query complexity |
| Security    | Views can restrict column access |
| Indexing    | Views don’t have indexes — rely on base tables |

---

### 📁 9. Best Practices

- Use views to **encapsulate business logic**
- Avoid joins and aggregations if you need **updatability**
- Use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` for safe updates
- Document view purpose and limitations in comments

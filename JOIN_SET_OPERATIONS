Here’s the **extended version** of your SQL Set Difference Cheat Sheet, Saibabu — now including **performance benchmarks**, **engine-specific notes**, and a **practice challenge section** to round it out.

## 🧠 SQL Set Difference Cheat Sheet  
**EXCEPT vs NOT IN vs LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL vs NOT EXISTS**

### 🔹 1. Syntax Comparison

| Technique              | Description                                                                 | Syntax Example                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **EXCEPT**             | Returns rows from first query not in second (set difference)               | `SELECT id FROM A EXCEPT SELECT id FROM B;`                                    |
| **NOT IN**             | Filters rows where value is not in a subquery result                       | `SELECT id FROM A WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM B);`                         |
| **LEFT JOIN + IS NULL**| Joins two tables and filters unmatched rows                                | `SELECT A.id FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id WHERE B.id IS NULL;`           |
| **NOT EXISTS**         | Filters rows where no match exists in subquery                             | `SELECT id FROM A WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM B WHERE B.id = A.id);`      |

### 🔹 2. Use Case Comparison

| Use Case                          | Best Technique(s)                     |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Set difference between tables** | `EXCEPT`, `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL`     |
| **Scalar filtering**              | `NOT IN`, `NOT EXISTS`                |
| **Handling NULLs safely**         | `NOT EXISTS`, `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` |
| **Performance on large joins**    | `NOT EXISTS`, `EXCEPT` (PostgreSQL)   |
| **MySQL compatibility**           | `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL`, `NOT EXISTS` |

---

### 🔹 3. Engine Support

| Technique     | MySQL | PostgreSQL | SQL Server | Oracle |
|---------------|-------|------------|------------|--------|
| `EXCEPT`      | ❌     | ✅          | ✅          | ✅      |
| `NOT IN`      | ✅     | ✅          | ✅          | ✅      |
| `LEFT JOIN`   | ✅     | ✅          | ✅          | ✅      |
| `NOT EXISTS`  | ✅     | ✅          | ✅          | ✅      |

---

### 🔹 4. Performance & Safety Tips

- ✅ `NOT EXISTS` is safest when dealing with **NULLs** — avoids unexpected exclusions.
- ⚠️ `NOT IN` fails if subquery returns **NULLs** — use `NOT EXISTS` instead.
- 🔄 `EXCEPT` removes duplicates unless using `EXCEPT ALL` (PostgreSQL only).
- 🐢 `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` is intuitive but slower on large datasets.
- 🔒 Always validate subquery results for NULLs when using `NOT IN`.

### 🔹 5. Real-World Example: Missing Customers

```sql
-- Using EXCEPT
SELECT customer_id FROM orders
EXCEPT
SELECT customer_id FROM loyalty_members;

-- Using NOT EXISTS
SELECT customer_id
FROM orders o
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM loyalty_members lm WHERE lm.customer_id = o.customer_id
);

-- Using LEFT JOIN
SELECT o.customer_id
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN loyalty_members lm ON o.customer_id = lm.customer_id
WHERE lm.customer_id IS NULL;
```

### 🔹 6. Performance Benchmarks (PostgreSQL Example)

| Technique     | Execution Time | Notes                                 |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `EXCEPT`      | Fastest         | Set-based, optimized for difference   |
| `NOT EXISTS`  | Very fast       | Index-aware, NULL-safe                |
| `LEFT JOIN`   | Moderate        | Slower on large joins                 |
| `NOT IN`      | Risky           | Fails with NULLs, slower on large sets|

> Tip: Always test with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to compare query plans in your engine.

---

### 🔹 7. Practice Challenge

**Dataset:**  
- `employees(emp_id, emp_name)`  
- `terminated(emp_id)`

**Task:**  
Find all current employees who are **not** in the terminated list using all four techniques.

```sql
-- EXCEPT
SELECT emp_id FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT emp_id FROM terminated;

-- NOT IN
SELECT emp_id FROM employees
WHERE emp_id NOT IN (SELECT emp_id FROM terminated);

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT e.emp_id
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN terminated t ON e.emp_id = t.emp_id
WHERE t.emp_id IS NULL;

-- NOT EXISTS
SELECT emp_id
FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM terminated t WHERE t.emp_id = e.emp_id
);
```

Would you like me to format this into a workbook section with editable headers for engine-specific notes, or add a challenge tracker for practice queries? I can also build a companion section for **joins vs set operators** if you're expanding your SQL mastery workbook.
